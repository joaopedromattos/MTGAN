# DCGAN - Baseline

This folder contains a simple implementation of DCGAN, from the [official PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html).

The main purpose of this baseline is to establish a feasible starting point to our group. Thus, we chose DCGAN, an easy and well known GAN architecture.
